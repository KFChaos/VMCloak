The development of the VMCloak project has been sponsored by the
`iTES Project <http://www.ites-project.org/index_en.html>`_, a research
project between `Avira <http://www.avira.com/>`_ and the `German Federal
Ministry of Education and Research <http://www.bmbf.de/en/index.php>`_.

Without the help of `nLite <http://www.nliteos.com/>`_ this tool would
probably not have been as complete as it is now. Inspiration on how to design
the output ISO files has for a large part been derived from changes observed
by ``nLite``.
